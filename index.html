            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Just a story</p>
            <p>Since 2014, I began to study HTML markup, CSS styles and typesetting simple pages, I was interested in it back then, a long time ago ... But it wasn’t a simple training at the university, and the work took all the time, the successes were
                tiny. But I didn’t after 5 years (horror, as much as 5 years passed) I did not stop dreaming of better times when I will start devoting my time to website development, and do it with a creative approach. Now I’m incredibly close to accomplishing
                an idea, I’ve been tempted to study, I haven’t been giving up and have been idle since June, every day I read and try to write something. Now is the best time for me to achieve a result. If I don’t pass this set, I’ll come to the next
                one, buy books, watch video courses at ITVDN, I will do everything to achieve my goal.</p>
