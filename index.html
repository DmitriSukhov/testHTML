            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Just a story</p>
            <p>Since 2014, I began to study HTML markup, CSS styles and typesetting simple pages, I was interested in it
                back then, a long time ago ... But it wasn’t a simple training at the university, and the work took all
                the time, the successes were
                tiny. But I didn’t after 5 years (horror, as much as 5 years passed) I did not stop dreaming of better
                times when I will start devoting my time to website development, and do it with a creative approach. Now
                I’m incredibly close to accomplishing
                an idea, I’ve been tempted to study, I haven’t been giving up and have been idle since June, every day I
                read and try to write something. Now is the best time for me to achieve a result. If I don’t pass this
                set, I’ll come to the next
                one, buy books, watch video courses at ITVDN, I will do everything to achieve my goal.</p>

                I completed my undergraduate studies at samara state aerospace university in 2017, specializing in laser
                technology.
                Mostly laser fried pita bread. And sometimes they were engaged in Raman spectroscopy and diagnosed
                cancers of human tissues.

            <h3>English</h3>
            <p>London - the Capital of Great Britain...
                I study English using mobile applications, I try to read all TK and google in English, I specially went
                through the Code Academy - because everything is in English there. I read the book "Martian" in the
                original.
                I can discuss some topics, I don’t always understand it by ear, and today, honestly, I don’t have a rich
                vocobulary. But I am working on it.</p>
